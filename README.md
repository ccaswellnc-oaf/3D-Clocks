# 3D-Clocks
Arduino code for clock projects I created for family, including code and STL files for printing.

The Firefly branch was made to adapt the time display code to a "Firefly" theme inspired by
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6778004 which is a shadowbox design. I modified the layers to
make room for the display
